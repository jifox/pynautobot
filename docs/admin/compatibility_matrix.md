# Compatibility Matrix

While that last supported version will not be strictly enforced--via the max_version setting, any issues with an updated Nautobot supported version in a minor release, will require a bug to be raised and a fix in Nautobot core to address, with no fixes expected in this SDK. Some features may not be fully available, see the release notes for when new Nautobot feature groups (such as DCIM, IPAM, Wireless, Cloud) are supported.
